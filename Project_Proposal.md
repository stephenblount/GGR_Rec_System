## Garage Gym Reviews Recommendation Engine 

Since the onset of the CoronaVirus, people have been more hesitant than ever to step foot into a gym. Over the last couple of years the market for personal home gym equipment has exploded. With the immense variety of gym equipment on the market and many new companies popping up to try to carve out their share of the market, reliable reviews have become more important than ever.  Additionally, purchasing heavy pieces of equipment through the mail costs a substantial amount to ship and returning heavy items can be next to impossible. This increases the need to be certain that the buyer is going to be happy with their purchase before pulling the trigger and reviews can help with this decision making process. 

Garage Gym Reviews or GGR is a website where the author blogs in depth about different pieces of gym equipment suitable for the average home gym owner. This website consists of 430 blog posts, with most posts exceeding 1,500 words. The goal for this project is to scrape these 430 blog posts and try to create a recommendation engine. This engine will say something along the lines of, “if you enjoyed this blog about X, you might like this blog about Y.”
The goal will be to group the blog posts into different categories through topic modeling.

An MVP will be a smaller set of cleaned documents from the corpus that have been sorted into different topic groups.
